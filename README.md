# üìù Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy

This project is part of my Elevvo Internship (NLP Track).  
The goal of this task is to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the CoNLL-2003 dataset and spaCy‚Äôs pre-trained models.

## üìå Project Steps

Step 1: Import Libraries  
I imported all the required libraries including spaCy for natural language processing, displacy for visualization, and seqeval for evaluation metrics.

Step 2: Upload Dataset  
I uploaded the CoNLL-2003 dataset files (train, test, validation) to Colab using files.upload(). These files contain tokenized sentences with their ground truth NER labels.

Step 3: Read and Prepare Data  
I defined a function to read the CoNLL data format.  
- It collects tokens and their corresponding labels for each sentence.  
- Finally, it returns a list of sentences (`train_sentences`) and their labels (`train_labels`).

Step 4: Load spaCy Model  
I loaded the spaCy English model en_core_web_sm, which comes with a pre-trained Named Entity Recognition component.

Step 5: Run NER on a Sample Sentence  
I tested the model on one example sentence from the training set.  
The model outputs named entities such as PERSON, ORG, and GPE, and I printed them out to verify the predictions.

Step 6: Visualization with displacy  
I used spaCy‚Äôs built-in displacy visualizer to highlight named entities in the text with different colors for better understanding.

Step 7: Evaluate the Model  
I compared spaCy‚Äôs predictions with the ground truth labels from the dataset using seqeval metrics.  
The evaluation provides Precision, Recall, and F1-score, along with a detailed classification report for each entity type.
